# GSA API Documentation Template - accessible and using USWDS

This is an updated version of the GSA API Documentation template. It has the following improvements:
- Has passed 508 accessibility testing
- Uses U.S. Web Design System

## Running locally

Because this uses HTML and JavaScript, the files can be opened locally in the browser.

However, to run the Swagger UI, it will need to be run on a webserver.

An example of a simple local web server on a Mac is to run the following command in the root directory:

`python -m http.server`
